# FlowerBloom-Iris-Species-Classification-with-Decision-Trees
This repository contains a Python project demonstrating Decision Trees' use for classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The primary goal of this project is to create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically, allowing for accurate predictions of Iris species when new data is provided.


Key Features:
1. Iris Dataset: The project utilizes the popular Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing measurements of Iris flowers' sepal and petal lengths and widths.

2. Decision Tree Classifier: A Decision Tree classifier is trained on the Iris dataset using the scikit-learn library. Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable classification algorithms.

3. Visualization: The Decision Tree classifier is visualized in a graphical format to provide insights into how it makes classification decisions.

4. Accuracy Score: The project calculates and prints the accuracy score in percentage format, demonstrating the classifier's performance on a test dataset.

5. Predictions: Users can predict new Iris data, with the classifier providing the predicted Iris species.

6. Data Exploration: The code includes data exploration and visualization using Seaborn to understand the Iris dataset better.



Usage: 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to create and visualize the Decision Tree classifier. 
3. Input new Iris data to make predictions on the species.

1. Python 3.x
2. scikit-learn
3. pandas
4. NumPy
5. seaborn
6. Matplotlib
